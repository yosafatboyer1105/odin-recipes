            </ul>
        </li>

            <ul>
                <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a wok or large pan over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Add chopped onions and garlic. Saut√© until they are fragrant and the onions are translucent.</li>
                <li>Add the mixed vegetables and stir-fry until they are tender-crisp.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Push vegetables to the side</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Push the vegetables to the side of the wok or pan to make space for the eggs.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Scramble the eggs</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Pour the beaten eggs into the cleared space. Allow them to set for a moment and then scramble them until they're cooked through.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Combine with rice</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Add the cooked rice to the wok or pan. Use a spatula to break up any clumps.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Add sauces</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Pour soy sauce, oyster sauce (if using), and sesame oil over the rice. Toss everything together until well combined.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Season and garnish</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add chopped green onions for freshness and extra flavor.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Stir-fry</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Continue stir-frying the rice mixture over medium-high heat until it's heated through and has a slightly crispy texture.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Serve</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Once everything is well mixed and heated, remove the fried rice from the heat.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Garnish & enjoy</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Garnish with additional green onions if desired. Serve the fried rice hot, either as a side dish or a main course.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
